# timezone: Set the time zone to be displayed on maps and the web pages.
# The default "local" will retrieve the timezone from the machine on
# which ShakeMap is running. This is the normal behavior, but there 
# are instances where the operator may wish different behavior, for 
# example when processing events in another time zone, or for machines 
# whose internal representation of the time zone is different from the 
# local time zone. 
#
# Acceptable values are "local", "GMT", "UTC", and time zones specified
# using the Olson database convention (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles"). 
# Do NOT specify time zones like 'PST' or 'PDT' -- these will result in 
# unpredictable bahavior and very confused web pages. Note that where the 
# time zone is printed with the time, the zone name can be shortened 
# according to local convention and daylight savings time will be handled 
# properly. Usually. (See "time_format", below, for more information.)
#
# It is the operator's responsibility to use a valid time zone specification
# that is available on the ShakeMap processing machine (on linux/unix-like 
# systems, these entries are usually found under the directory 
# /usr/share/zoneinfo). 
#
# Example:
#
#	timezone : America/Los_Angeles
#
# Note: This setting is used for both the ShakeMap products and the web site,
# so if you change it for just one event, it will change the times (and
# possibly dates) in all of the archive lists on the web site (but not
# on the maps or other products themselves). If a subsequent event is
# back in the original time zone, the archives (including the earlier, out-
# of-zone event) will switch back, but the products of the one out-of-zone
# event will still be in the alternate time zone. The moral is: it's 
# probably best not to change this setting on a per-map basis unless
# you are not using the ShakeMap-generated web site. If you cover a lot
# of time zones, consider using UTC.

# time_format: set the format for times that are printed on the maps and
# web pages. The format is specified as a string as defined by the strftime
# library function and as implemented by the Perl DateTime module. See 
# http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime-1.07/lib/DateTime.pm#strftime_Patterns
# for a full list of available patterns.
#
# If you are using a local/regional time zone (i.e., not GMT/UTC), then
# you'll probably want to stick with:
#
#	time_format : %r %Z
#
# which will print something like "08:15:22 AM PST" -- that is, 12-hour time
# plus AM or PM (or the local equivalent), plus the shortened name of the
# (possibly daylight savings time corrected) time zone.
#
# On the other hand, if you are using GMT/UTC or your local/national
# convention is to use 24-hour time, you may want:
#
#	time_format : %T %Z
#
# which will give the time in 24-hour format (with no AM/PM indicator) 
# followed by the time zone.
# 
# Any other valid pattern (including ones with embedded strings) are allowed,
# but should be carefully considered. Remember your audience.

# date_format: set the format for dates that are printed on the maps and
# web pages. The format is specified as a string as defined by the strftime
# library function and as implemented by the Perl DateTime module. See 
# http://search.cpan.org/~drolsky/DateTime-1.07/lib/DateTime.pm#strftime_Patterns
# for a full list of available patterns.
#
# This is a bit more tricky than times, since international conventions
# vary quite a bit. The most important thing to remember is to keep the
# output short -- remember that these dates will be printed on the maps
# and the web pages.
#
# For United States regional operators, the recommended format is:
#
#	date_format : %b %e, %Y
#
# which prints something like "Jul 17, 2014" and is consistent with what
# ShakeMap has been using all along.
#
# For other operators, as with the time format above, let local convention
# dictate. Generally, though, it's best to keep it simple with something like:
#
#	date_format : %e %b %Y
#
# which prints like "12 Jul 2014". Or you could stick with the ISO-8601
# international standard:
#
#	date_format : %F
#
# which prints like "2014-07-17".
#
# Note that in one or two places in the products we print a shortened 
# date format. In these cases we use the standard (%F) yyyy-mm-dd 
# format.
