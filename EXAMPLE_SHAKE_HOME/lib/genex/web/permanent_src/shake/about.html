    <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      A ShakeMap is a representation of ground shaking produced by an 
      earthquake. The information it presents is different from the 
      earthquake magnitude and epicenter that are released after an 
      earthquake because 
      ShakeMap focuses on the ground shaking produced by the earthquake, 
      rather than the parameters describing the earthquake source. So, while 
      an earthquake has one magnitude and one epicenter, it produces a range 
      of ground shaking levels at sites throughout the region depending on 
      distance from the earthquake, the rock and soil conditions at sites, 
      and variations in the propagation of seismic waves from the earthquake 
      due to complexities in the structure of the Earth's crust.
    </p>
    <P>
      Part of the strategy for generating rapid-response ground motion 
      maps is to determine the best format for reliable presentation of the 
      maps given the diverse audience, which includes scientists, businesses, 
      emergency response agencies, media, and the general public.
      In an effort to simplify and maximize the flow of information to the 
      public, we have developed a means of generating not only peak 
      ground acceleration and velocity maps, but also an 
      instrumentally-derived, estimated Modified Mercalli Intensity map. 
      This map makes it easier to relate the recorded ground motions to the 
      expected felt and damage distribution. The Instrumental Intensity map 
      is based on a combined regression of recorded peak acceleration 
      and velocity amplitudes. <A HREF="#intmaps">(see Intensity Maps)</A>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the

	<a href="<!-- tmpl_var name="stationmap" -->" target="_top">
      <!-- /tmpl_if -->
      current <!-- tmpl_var name="region" --> station distribution</a>, 
      data gaps are 
      common, particularly for smaller events and events near or outside the 
      edge of the network. In order to stabilize contouring and minimize
      the misrepresentation of the ground motion pattern due to data gaps, 
      we augment the data with predicted values in areas 
      without data. Given the epicenter and magnitude, peak motion amplitudes 
      in spare regions are estimated from the Joyner, Boore, and Fumal (1997),
      and Joyner and Boore (1988) attenuation curves. As the real-time 
      <!-- tmpl_var name="region" --> station density increases, this 
      difficulty should be alleviated.
      Small open circles represent "phantom" grid stations where strong 
      motion values were estimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note</b>: ShakeMaps are generated automatically following moderate 
      and large earthquakes. These are preliminary ground shaking maps, 
      normally posted within several minutes of the earthquake origin time. 
      The acceleration and velocity values are raw and are at least initially, 
      NOT checked by humans. Further, since ground motions and intensities 
      typically can vary significantly over small distances, these maps are 
      only APPROXIMATE. At small scales, they should be considered unreliable. 
      Finally, the input data is raw and unchecked, and may contain errors.

      When viewing the peak ground motion maps using a Javascript-enabled 
      browser, additional information about
      the earthquake epicenter and recording seismic stations can be viewed.
      A brief summary line is displayed when the mouse pointer is over the 
      epicenter symbol or a station symbol. If the symbol is clicked, a
      small window with a table of information will be opened. This window can
      be moved to a preferred location, and clicking on the tab bar to see 
      another map will close the current information window.

      The instrumental intensity map does not show station symbols and does 
      not have the popup information window. The legend bar at the bottom 
      explains the colors (and see <a href="#intmaps">Intensity Maps</a> 
      below).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the popup window, the earthquake information includes the event
      date, time, location coordinates in degrees latitude and longitude, 
      and hypocentral depth in kilometers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station information includes the station code and name,
      the agency that manages the station, the station location coordinates
      in degrees latitude and longitude, and the peak acceleration and 
      velocity values for each component of ground motion (when available).
      When the peak ground motion maps are made, the value from the peak 
      <b>horizontal</b> component of ground motion is used as the value for the
      station. This value is highlighted in bold in the station information.

      Components from many stations are defined by three letter codes. The last
      letter indicates the orientation (Z&nbsp;=&nbsp;vertical,

      The first two letters indicate the instrument

      FBA's (force balance accelerometers) are designed to record extremely 
      large ground motions and can accurately record waves from very large 
      earthquakes. However, ground motions from small and moderate earthquakes
      are often too small to trigger these instruments or rise above 
      instrument noise. On the other hand, Broadband seismic sensors can
      record extremely small ground motions and accurately record waves from
      earthquakes that range from very small up to moderately large. A 
      number of stations have both FBA and broadband sensors. For ShakeMap,
      the network tends to emphasize FBA recordings for large
      ground motions and broadband recordings for small ground motions.

    <h2><a name="accmaps">Peak Acceleration Maps</a></h2>

    <P>
      Peak horizontal acceleration at each station is contoured in units of 
      percent-g (where g&nbsp;=&nbsp;acceleration due to the force of 
      gravity&nbsp;=&nbsp;981&nbsp;cm/s/s).
      The peak values of the vertical components are not 
      used in the construction of the maps because the regression 
      relationships used to fill in data gaps between stations are based on
      horizontal peak amplitudes. The contour interval varies greatly and is 
      based on the maximum recorded value over the network for each event. 
    </P>
    <p>
      For moderate to large events, the pattern of peak ground acceleration
      is typically quite complicated, with extreme variability over distances 
      of a few km. This is attributed to the small scale geological 
      differences near the sites that can significantly change the 
      high-frequency acceleration amplitude and waveform character. Although 
      distance to the causative fault clearly dominates the 
      pattern, there are often exceptions, due to local amplification. 
      Although, this makes interpolation of ground motions at one site to a 
      nearby neighbor risky, the peak acceleration pattern usually reflects 
      what is felt from low levels of shaking up to to moderate 
      levels of damage.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="velmaps">Peak Velocity Maps</a></h2>

    <P>
      Peak velocity values are contoured for the maximum horizontal velocity 
      (in cm/sec) at each station. As with the acceleration maps, the vertical
      component amplitudes are disregarded for consistency with the regression
      relationships used to estimate values in gaps in the station 
      distribution. Typically, for moderate to large events, the pattern of 
      peak ground velocity reflects the pattern of the earthquake faulting 
      geometry, with largest amplitudes in the near-source region, and in the 
      direction of rupture (directivity). Differences between rock and soil 
      sites are apparent, but the overall pattern is normally simpler than 
      the peak acceleration pattern. Severe damage, and damage to flexible 
      structures is best related to ground velocity. For reference, the 
      largest recorded ground velocity (to date) was made at the Rinaldi 
      Receiving Station from the Northridge (Magnitude 6.7), topping out at 
      183 cm/sec.
    </P>

    <h2><a name="spmaps">Spectral Response Maps</a></h2>

    <p>
      Following earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.5, spectral response maps
      are made. Response spectra portray the response of a damped, 
      single-degree-of-freedom oscillator to the recorded ground motions. This
      data representation is useful for engineers determining how a structure
      will react to ground motions. The response is calculated for a range of
      periods. Within that range, the Uniform Building Code (UBC) refers to 
      particular reference periods that help define the shape of the 
      "design spectra" that reflects the building code.
    </p>

    <p>
      ShakeMap spectral response maps are made for the response at three
      UBC reference periods: 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 seconds. For each station, the
      value used is the peak horizontal value of 5% critically damped 
      pseudo-acceleration.
    </p>

    <h2><a name="intmaps">Rapid Instrumental Intensity Maps</a></h2>

    <p>
      As an effort to simplify and maximize the flow of information to the 
      public, we have developed a means of generating estimated Modified 
      Mercalli Intensity maps based on instrumental ground motion recordings. 
      This "Instrumental Intensity" is based on a combined regression of peak 
      acceleration and velocity amplitudes vs. observed intensity for eight 
      significant California earthquakes (1971 San Fernando, 1979 Imperial 
      Valley, 1986 North Palm Springs, 1987 Whittier, 1989 Loma Preita, 1991 
      Sierra Madre, 1992 Landers, and 1994 Northridge). 
    </p>

    <P>
      From the comparison with observed intensity maps, we find that a 
      regression based on peak velocity for intensity &gt; VII and on peak 
      acceleration for intensity &lt; VII is most suitable. This is 
      consistent with the notion that low intensities are determined by felt 
      accounts (sensitive to acceleration). Moderate damage, at intensity 
      VI-VII, typically occurs in rigid structures (masonry walls, chimneys, 
      etc.) which also are sensitive to high-frequency (acceleration) ground 
      motions. As damage levels increase, damage also occurs in flexible 
      structures, for which damage is proportional to the ground velocity, 
      not acceleration. By relating recorded ground motions to Modified 
      Mercalli intensities, we can now estimate shaking intensities within a 
      few minutes of the event based on the recorded peak motions made at 
      seismic stations.

    <h2><a name="spmaps">Uncertainty Maps</a></h2>

    <p>
     ShakeMaps are computed as the uncertainty-weighted combination of ground 
     motion amplitudes from a Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE), 
     seismic data, and (optionally) reports of macroseismic intensity. This 
     weighted-averaging process allows us to compute an uncertainty at each 
     grid point in a ShakeMap. Since the GMPE also provides an estimate of 
     ground motion uncertainty at each point, we can compute the ratio of 
     the final ShakeMap uncertainty to the GMPE uncertainty. This ratio lets 
     us know at each grid point if the ShakeMap is more or less uncertain 
     than a purely predictive map generated by the GMPE.
    </p>

    <p>
     We utilize the uncertainty ratio to produce a graded map of uncertainty. 
     Where the ratio is 1.0 (meaning the ShakeMap is purely predictive), the 
     map is colored white. Where the ratio is greater than 1.0 (meaning that 
     the ShakeMap uncertainty is high because of unknown fault geometry) the 
     map shades toward dark red, and where the uncertainty is less than 1.0 
     (because the presence of data decreases the uncertainty) the map shades 
     toward dark blue. These maps provide a quick visual summary of quality 
     of the ground motion estimates over the area of interest. ShakeMaps are 
     also given a letter grade, based on the mean uncertainty ratio within 
     the area of the MMI 6 contour (on the theory that this is the area most 
     important to accurately represent). A ratio of 1.0 is given a grade of 
     "C." Maps with mean ratios greater than 1.0 get grades of "D" or "F." 
     Ratios less than 1.0 earn grades of "B" or "A." If the map does not 
     contain areas of MMI >= 6, no grade is assigned.

    <h2><a name="scenario">Scenario Earthquakes</a></h2>

    <P>
      <i>Earthquake Scenarios</i> describe the expected ground motions 
      and effects of specific hypothetical large earthquakes. In planning 
      and coordinating emergency response, utilities, emergency responders, 
      and other agencies are best served by conducting training exercises 
      based on realistic earthquake situations, ones that they are most 
      likely to face. Scenario earthquakes can fill this role; they can 
      be generated for any potential hypothetical future or past historic
      earthquake by the following steps.
    </P>      

    <P>
      First, assume a particular fault or fault segment will rupture over a
      certain length relying on consensus-based information about the
      potential behavior of the fault. For historic events, the actual rupture
      dimensions may be constrained based on existing observations or models.
      Second, estimate ground motions at all locations in a chosen region
      surrounding the causative fault.
    </P>      
      
    <P>
      These earthquake scenarios are not earthquake predictions. That is, no
      one knows in advance when or how large a future earthquake will
      be. However, if we make assumptions about the size and location of a
      hypothetical future earthquake, we <i>can</i> make a reasonable
      prediction of the <i>effects</i> of the assumed earthquake, particularly
      the way in which the ground will shake. This knowledge of the potential
      shaking effects is the main benefit of the earthquake scenario for
      planning and preparedness purposes.
    </P>      

    <P><b>Choosing An Appropriate Earthquake Scenario</b>


<P><I>San Francisco Bay Area </I></P>

<P>The scenario earthquakes given on the Northern California ShakeMap web page
represent 34 possible future earthquakes in the greater San Francisco Bay area
as determined by the USGS-led 
<a href="http://quake.usgs.gov/research/seismology/wg02/" target="_top">
Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities.</a>
This Working Group (WG02) concluded that the likelihood of one or more
large (M>=6.7) earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay region in the next 30 years
is 62% [with an associated 95% confidence bound of 37-87%].  This regional result
combines the probabilities of earthquakes on each of seven characterized fault
systems as well as in the background.
As part of the Working Group process, the seven main Bay Area faults were
subdivided into 18 individual fault segments. These fault segments were considered
the basic building block for each fault; i.e., the shortest section considered
capable of repeatedly rupturing to produce large earthquakes. Each fault was divided
into as many as four, non-overlapping segments by evaluating data from past
earthquakes as well as the role of structural changes along the faults, such as bends,
intersections, gaps, and major changes in rock types.  Figure 1 shows the
characterized faults and segment boundaries.  </P>

<br>
<IMG SRC="icons/WG_study_region.jpg">
<br>

<P>The Working Group allowed for the possibility of either single segment or
 multi-segment earthquakes on the seven fault systems. Each possible
 combination of segments was called a rupture source and each rupture source
 represents a possible future ”scenario” earthquake.  WG02 assigned
 weights to the likelihood of occurrence of all combinations of the possible
 rupture sources for each fault system.  The resulting rupture sources—34
 in all—along with their mean magnitude, probability of occurring in the
 next 30 years, and the associated uncertainities in the probabilities are
 listed in Table 1. </P>

<P>These scenario ShakeMaps graphically illustrate the strength and regional
extent of shaking that can be expected from a specific future Bay Area
earthquakes. It is important to note that the predicted values are median
estimates: when a large earthquake actually occurs, the ground shaking may
exceed these estimates in some places and will be lower in others. </P>

    In California, the California Geological Survey (CGS) and the
    U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) have evaluated the probabilistic hazard
    from active faults in the state as part of the 
    <a href="http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/rghm/psha/index.htm">
    Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment For The State of California 
    described</a> by <a href="#peters96">Peterson et al. (1996)</a> and 
    the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazmaps/">National Seismic Hazard 
    Mapping Project</a> described by <a href="#frankel96">Frankel et al. 
    (1996)</a>.  From these maps it is possible to prioritize the best 
    scenario earthquakes to be used in planning exercises by considering 
    the most likely candidate earthquake fault first, followed by the 
    next likely, and so on. Such an analysis is easily accomplished by 
    <a href="http://eqint.cr.usgs.gov/eq-men/html/deaggint2002.html">hazard 
    deaggregation</a>, in which the contributions of individual 
    earthquakes to the total seismic hazard their probability of 
    occurrence and the severity of the ground motions are ranked in order. U
    sing the individual components ("deaggregations") of these hazard maps, 
    a user can properly select the appropriate scenarios given their 
    location, regional extent, and specific planning requirements. 
    Currently, the ShakeMap scenario events come directly out of the 
    <a href="http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/rghm/psha/ofr9608/index.htm">
    CGS catalog</a> of fault source parameters that make up the 
    statewide probabilistic seismic hazard assessment. Users interested 
    in specific scenarios for planning purposes are encouraged to make

    <P><b>Estimating Ground Motions for Scenario Earthquake ShakeMaps</b>. At
      present, ground motions are estimated using an <i>empirical attenuation
      relationship</i>, which is a predictive relationship that allows the
      estimation of the peak ground motions at a given distance and for an
      assumed magnitude. Thus, ground motions are estimated for a given
      magnitude earthquake, and at a particular distance from the assumed
      fault, in a manner consistent with recordings of past earthquakes under
      similar conditions. For ShakeMap, we use the relationship of <a
      href="#boore97">Boore et al. (1997)</a> for peak and spectral
      acceleration, and we use
      <a href="#jb88">Joyner and Boore's (1988)</a> relationship for peak
      velocity. We use these predictive relationships to estimate peak ground
      motions on rock sites, and then correct the amplitude at that location
      based on the site soil conditions as we do in the general ShakeMap
      interpolation scheme. Site conditions come directly from the Statewide
      Site Conditions Map for California
      <a href="#wills00">(Wills et al., 2000)</a>
      and we correct for site amplification with the amplitude and
      frequency-dependent factors determined 
      by <a href="#borcherdt94">Borcherdt (1994)</a>.
    </P>

    <P><b>Attributes and Limitations of Current Maps</b>. Our approach is
      simple and approximate.  We account for fault finiteness by measuring
      the distance to the surface projection of the fault location (Joyner and
      Boore's distance definition), but we do not consider the direction of
      rupture nor do we modify the peak motions by a directivity term. With
      this approach, the location of the earthquake epicenter does not have
      any effect on the resulting ground motions; only the location and
      dimensions of the fault matter. If we were to add directivity to the
      calculations, than different choices of epicentral location would result
      in significantly difference motions for the same magnitude earthquake
      and fault segment.  Rather, our approach here is to show the average
      effect since it is difficult to show results for every possible
      epicentral location.
    </P>

    <P>
      Our empirical predictive approach also only gives average peak ground
      motions values so it does not account for all the expected variability
      in motions, other than the aforementioned site amplification
      variations. Actual ground motions show significant variability for a
      given distance, magnitude, and site condition and, hence, the scenario
      ground motions are more uniform than would be expected for an actual
      earthquake. The true variations are partially attributable to 2D and 3D
      wave propagation, path effects (such as basin edge amplification and
      focusing), differences in motions among earthquakes of the same
      magnitude, and complex site effects not accounted for by our method.
    </P>

    <P><b>Uses</b>. Earthquake scenarios are used heavily in emergency
      response planning. Primary users for response planning include city,
      county, state and federal government agencies (e.g., the California
      Office of Emergency Services, FEMA, the Army Corp of Engineers),
      emergency response planners and managers for utilities, businesses, and
      other large organizations.  Scenarios are also used for loss-estimation
      by utilities, governments, and industry.
    </P>

    <P>
      Scenarios are of fundamental interest to the community and scientific
      audiences interested in the nature of the ground shaking likely
      experienced in past earthquakes as well as the possible effects due to
      rupture on known faults in the future.
    </P>

    <P>
      In addition, more detailed and careful analysis of the ground motion
      time histories (seismograms) produced by such scenario earthquakes is
      highly beneficial for earthquake engineering considerations. Engineers
      require site-specific ground motions for detailed structural response
      analysis of existing structures and future structures designed around
      specified performance levels. In the future, with these scenarios we
      will also provide synthetic time histories of strong ground motions that
      include rupture directivity effects.
    </P>

    <P>
    <b>Future Scientific Advances</b>. While current earthquake modeling
    techniques are sufficient for providing useful motion time histories and
    scenario ShakeMaps based on empirical means (e.g., ground motion
    attenuation relations), substantial improvement will require developing
    cost-effective numerical tools for proper theoretical inclusion of known
    complex ground motion effects.  These efforts are underway and must
    continue in order to obtain site, basin and deeper crustal structure, to
    characterize and test 3D earth models (including attenuation and
    nonlinearity), and to improve numerical wave propagation methods to obtain
    useful, site-specific, ground motion time histories.
