The website is contained the five sets of directories that play different 
roles.

permanent_src: 
	   These files do not change with each event, and are not propagated
           to the website each time 'genex' is run.  If changes are made to
           these files or web.conf (in the ShakeMap config directory (not the
	   config directory here)), the changed files will need to be remade 
	   (using 'make web' from the home directory) which will fill the 
	   templates and move the html to 'permanent'.

permanent: These files are the filled templates from permanent_src. They must
	   be transfered to the website manually (using transfer -permweb, 
	   or something similar).

mech_defaults:
	   These are the default focal mechanism files (which basically
	   say that the mechanism isn't available yet).  These files do not 
	   change with each event, but *are* propagated to the website each 
	   time 'genex' is run.  Some or all of these files may be 
	   overwritten on the web site and in the event data directory 
	   by event-specific files 

template:  These files are templates for pages that change with each event.
           When 'genex' is run, the templates are filled with event-specific 
	   data, and the resulting files are deposited in the event's data
	   directory and from there they are propagated to the website.
	
config :   These are XML files which determine the look and behavior
	   of the web site navigation bars/menus/tabs and also the
	   archive pages.  These may be edited to customize the site.
	   The effects will be seen the next time 'genex' is run and
	   the results transferred to the web site.
